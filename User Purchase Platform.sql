Table: Spending
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| spend_date  | date    |
| platform    | enum    |
| amount      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
The table logs the spendings history of users
that make purchases from an online shopping website which has a desktop and a mobile application.

(user_id, spend_date, platform) is the primary key of this table.
The platform column is an ENUM type of ('desktop', 'mobile').

Write an SQL query to find the total number of users
and the total amount spent using mobile only, desktop only
and both mobile and desktop together for each date.

The query result format is in the following example:

Spending table:
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100    |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
Result table:
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
| spend_date | platform | total_amount | total_users |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
| 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | both     | 200          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | both     | 0            | 0           |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
On 2019-07-01, user 1 purchased using both desktop and mobile, user 2 purchased using mobile only and user 3 purchased using desktop only.
On 2019-07-02, user 2 purchased using mobile only, user 3 purchased using desktop only and no one purchased using both platforms.
