# Requirement:
Table: Customers
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
| email         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the email of a customer of an online shop.


Table: Contacts
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | id      |
| contact_name  | varchar |
| contact_email | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(user_id, contact_email) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and email of one contact of customer with user_id.
This table contains information about people each customer trust.
The contact may or may not exist in the Customers table.


Table: Invoices
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| invoice_id   | int     |
| price        | int     |
| user_id      | int     |
+--------------+---------+
invoice_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has an invoice with invoice_id and a price.


Write an SQL query to find the following for each invoice_id:

customer_name: The name of the customer the invoice is related to.
price: The price of the invoice.
contacts_cnt: The number of contacts related to the customer.
trusted_contacts_cnt: The number of contacts related to the customer and at the same time they are customers to the shop.
(i.e His/Her email exists in the Customers table.)
Order the result table by invoice_id.

The query result format is in the following example:

Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------------+
| customer_id | customer_name | email              |
+-------------+---------------+--------------------+
| 1           | Alice         | alice@leetcode.com |

| 6           | Alice        | alice@leetcode.com |
+-------------+--------------+--------------------+
